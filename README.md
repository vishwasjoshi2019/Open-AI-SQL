# Natural Language to SQL Query Conversion App

Welcome to the Natural Language to SQL Query Conversion App! This project combines the power of React, Node.js, and OpenAI's API to transform natural language prompts into SQL queries. With this app, you can easily convert human-readable English sentences into functional SQL queries for your database operations.

## Overview

This full-stack application consists of both a client and a server component, each with its own set of npm packages and functionalities. The client handles user interaction and input, while the server leverages OpenAI's GPT-3.5 architecture and text completion API to generate SQL queries based on the provided natural language prompts.



## Getting Started

To begin, clone this repository to your local machine and navigate to the root directory. The repository includes two main folders: "client" for the front end and "server" for the backend.

### Installing Dependencies

Start by installing the necessary dependencies for both the client and the server. In the terminal, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the "client" folder and run:
   ```bash
   npm install
2. Next, navigate to the "server" folder and run::
   ```bash
   npm install
   
## To experience the app, make sure both the client and the server are up and running.
1. Navigate to the "client" folder in the terminal and execute:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
2. Navigate to the "server" folder in the terminal and execute:
   ```bash
   npm start

## Technologies Used
The front end of this application is built with React, offering an intuitive interface for inputting natural language prompts. The backend is powered by Node.js and Express, facilitating communication with the OpenAI API for generating SQL queries based on the provided prompts.
